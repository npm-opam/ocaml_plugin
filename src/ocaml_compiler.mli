(**
   This module offers an higher level api over Ocaml_dynloader.
   This retrieves the compiler and a bunch of cmi files embedded in the current
   executable, and use them to do the compilation of ocaml source files,
   before loading them using Dynlink. The compilation steps happen in Async.

   This is meant to be used in unix only, in particular because it uses /proc to
   determine the location of the exec code being run.

  (**
     Code_style can be specified statically in a jbuild...

     {[
       (embed (
         ...
         (code_style ppx)))
     ]}

     ...or dynamically using the above [code_style] create_argument.

     The static selection controls which preprocessors are embedded in the archive.
     The dynamic controls which preprocessor (if any) to use when loading a plugin.

     The dynamically requested preprocessor shall be present in the archive, otherwise
     an exception will be raised during the compilation of the plugin.

     If the optional [code_style] argument is not given, the behaviour is determined by
     the contents of the archive:

     - if neither preprocessor is embedded, do [No_preprocessing].
     - if just one preprocessor (camlp4 or ppx) is embedded, it is used.
     - if both are embedded, use ppx (it's the future!).

     A simple migration path which requires no application code changes is:
     - select (code_style ppx) in the jbuild.
     - build & roll out a new executable, and switch all plugins to ppx-style.
     (The new executable will contain only the ppx preprocessor)

     A more complex migration path (requires application code changes):
     - select (code_style bilingual)
     - Modify the plugin-app to select dynamically the [code_style] to use;
         perhaps using a command line flag, or other config parameters.
         See [ ../test/plugin_loader.ml].
     - Build and roll out; Adapt plugins to ppx-style as required.
     (The new executable will contain both camlp4 & ppx preprocessors)

  -> ?persistent_archive_dirpath:string
  (**
     Keep the extracted archive in some persistent location to avoid paying the cost of
     extraction each time a file needs to be compiled.
     The location passed will not be cleaned at the end of the execution of the
     program. The only guarantee given there is that it is never going to grow more than
     the size of the embedded archive.
     If the persistent location contains a extracted version that is older than the
     current executable, the directory is cleaned up and the archive is extracted again.

) Ocaml_dynloader.create_arguments

(**
   This is a special utilisation of the Generic Loader.
   It relies on a few assumptions, such as a file called ocamlopt.opt
   is present in the archive, as well as some cmi files,
   and uses a tmp compilation_directory.
   A call to this function will retrieve the embedded part of the code,
   and extract it in the current corresponding directory.
   The most common use and the default value for [code_file] is [`my_code].
   Currently this library works with native code only. Called in bytecode,
   this function will return the exception [Ocaml_dynloader.Is_not_native]
   See the documentation of ocaml_dynloader for other flags, they are
   passed internally to that module to create the internal dynloader
   (in _dir, custom_warnings_spec, etc.).

   /!\ By using this manual create, you take the responsibility to call [clean t] when
   you're done with all the compilation that you want to do with this compiler.  Consider
   using [with_compiler], [Make] or [load_ocaml_src_files] if this makes your life
   simpler.
*)
val create : (
  unit -> [`this_needs_manual_cleaning_after of t] Deferred.Or_error.t
) create_arguments

(**
   Call create, do something with the compiler, and then take care of calling clean.
   In case an exception or a shutdown happen and f never returns, an attempt to clean the
   compiler is still done via an at_shutdown execution.

*)
val loader : t -> Ocaml_dynloader.t

(**
   This will delete the temporary directory created, and remove all
   the files, included the files generated by the loader.
   This function should be used when the compiler has been created using [create] for
   advanced use of this module. For a simpler usage, look at [with_compiler] or the
   functor below.

      given. Also provides a [-ocamldep] mode allowing only the main file to be passed on
      the command line.

      When [with_code_style_switch:false], the code style is the same as for
      [with_compiler].  One may use [true] if both camlp4 and ppx are embedded, in which
      case a [-code-style] flag is provided in the command line to pick between camlp4 and
      ppx to perform the validation. *)

  (** [Load] contains functions similar to the ones above, and can be used if you want to
      separate extraction of the compiler from building/loading files. It can be useful if
      you want to extract the compiler upfront (to improve latency a bit) or if you want
      to share the cost of extracting the compiler for the current executable over
      multiple compilations. Probably not needed by the casual user *)
