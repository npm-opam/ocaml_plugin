(* Call ocamldep to recursively find dependencies for the [target] compilation unit,
   return a list of compilation units the [target] depends on in topological order.
   Failure cases includes:
   - cannot run ocamldep.opt
   - invalid working_dir, target not found
   - ocamldep errors (the program crashes, syntax errors, etc.)
   - cyclic dependency detected

   A compilation unit is a string representing an ml/mli module.
   it does not contain the extension. Example:

   file              compilation unit
   a.mli?            "a"
   Stack.mli?        "Stack"
   /path/to/file.ml  "file"
   /other/file.ml    "file"

   This function assumes that the target and all its dependencies are located under the
   same directory, that is [working_dir], and that an .ml and an .mli for the same module
   have the same case. *)
